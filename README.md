Shadow Room – WebGL Demo

This is a complex WebGL demo that uses graphics programming to render a 3D room with dynamic shadows based on a moving light source. It showcases advanced techniques in WebGL including shaders, lighting models, and transformation matrices. There are interactable controls to control/move the light source and toggle cube rotation or lighting.

The scene is fully rendered using raw WebGL without external frameworks. All transformations, lighting calculations, and projections are implemented manually in JavaScript.

Features
